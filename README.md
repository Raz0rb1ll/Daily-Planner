Developer Warnings:
Compatibility: The app is compatible with devices running Android 5 and above.
Local Storage: The app stores notes locally, which means if you uninstall the app or clear its
data you will lose its notes stored in it.
It also means that if the device has limited memory (temporary or permanent), there is a risk that
changes might not be saved.
Security: Since the data is stored in memory, it is not recommended to store sensitive
information in the app because in the event of a device breach, the information will not be
encrypted.
Screen Orientation: The app is designed to function in portrait mode. If the screen rotates
horizontally, it is a device issue, and you should fix it from its settings.
Usage Instructions:
Dates: The app provides four weeks, each with seven days, where you can set the dates at the
top of the screen by pressing the "Date",”Week1”,”Week2”,”Week3”,”Week4” button.
Notes: You can write your daily notes for each day. However, the notes or date settings will only
be saved when you press a button at the bottom of the screen.
Those Buttons are :(“Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday”, “Friday”, “Saturday”,
“Sunday”, “Menu 1”, “Menu 2”, “Menu 3”, ”Week 1”, “Week 2”, “Week 3”, “Week 4”, “Main
